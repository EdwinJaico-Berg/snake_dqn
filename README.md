## Snake AI

This is a simple AI agent that uses deep Q learning to play the game of Snake. The agent receives a set of observations from the game environment and uses them to learn how to navigate the game and maximize its score.

To train the agent, we use a deep neural network to approximate the Q-value function for the game. This allows the agent to learn from its experiences and improve its performance over time.

Once the agent is trained, it can be used to play the game of Snake in real-time, using the learned Q-values to make decisions about which direction to move in at each step.
